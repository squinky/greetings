The ritual of greeting is important to many societies, both human and otherwise. We recognize one anotherâ€™s intentions by the complex ways that we greet each other. From changing forms of address to different physical interactions across cultures, there are many ways to say hello.

You, too, can discover the many complexities of learning a new greeting ritual. You and a partner will be given a series of instructions that form your new personal greeting and asked to complete this greeting as quickly as possible. To begin, find a partner, and together, clear your minds to allow for calibration. Sound the gong to start.
